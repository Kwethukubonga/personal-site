                Growing up with a mom who always gave back, service wasn’t just something I did, it was something I lived.
                At 15, I founded <strong>Uplift Foundation</strong> with a simple goal: to give back.
            </p>

            <p>
                My first initiative was a Christmas Charity Drive for LIV Village, a home for orphaned and vulnerable children. I went door-to-door in my community, collecting donations. Thanks to their generosity, we gathered books, shoes, clothes, and raised R1500, which went directly to LIV Village.
            </p>
            <p>
                My friends and family helped a lot, we stayed up all night baking and putting together gift bags.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also reached out to brands, and they showed up. We served 150 Real Deal pizzas from Debonairs and 150 original glazed doughnuts from Krispy Kreme. It was a day of joy, and community.
